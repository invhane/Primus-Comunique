            <p>How does an entity come into being? First, someone must coin a name or a term. A name that would distinguish that entity apart from the rest.</p>
        <br>
            <p>It was not so long ago, when on April 30, 1997, Merryland Tutorial Center was established. The directress, Teacher Ella, because of her utmost aim of paying tribute to the ever-kindness of her mother-in-law, Mrs. Rosita B. Ulanday, whose nickname is Mary, she coined the term Merryland. Basically, the tutorial center was named after her (Mary or Merry makes no difference after all).</p>
        <br>
            <p>Initially, there were only 25 students and four teachers. These students were basically the children of the acquaintances of the directress herself. Not so long thereafter, the number of enrollees increased despite the fact that she didn't indulge into any sort of advertisement. Merryland Tutorial Center had earned its merits on its own. Sooner, it became internationalized to a certain extent. Foreigners like Indians, Chinese and English, among others, came in. In its very humble measure, its popularity could be attributed to its sincere end of reaching the gifted and mediocre alike.</p>

            <p>Sometime in 1999, T. Ella entertained the idea of establishing a school because of the encouragement of her family and some close friends. At first, she was somewhat adamant because it would require her to select them between two distinct fields that she valued equally - whether she would pursue her career in the legal profession or to give away to the request of her family and friends. Finally, she chose the latter in lieu of the former, she believed that the decision was not hers alone but God's first and foremost MERRYLAND MONTESORRI SCHOOL, INC. came into being, not by chance, but for a purpose. God has indeed entrusted a noble duty to but few hands, yet by His grace, the very mission that the school carries would eventually redound to the benefit of our nation's hope - our youngsters.</p>
